Welcome to Contribute RichUtils!

Although this library doesn't have any code rules, here is **very basic rule**.

* If you plan to PR, please give me as other branch. not master.
* If you plan to write issues, please give me specific content of issue. not "Not working" something. it will be closed.

Thank you for following up make android development great again with Kotlin :)
